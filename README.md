# cifar_pytorch_networks
The main idea comes from https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar

I modified and added more deep learning networks for cifar classification since 2019. I upload it now for the beginners to quickly get familiar with CNNs backbones.

Instructions: in main.py, choose the net you want to run, e.g., net = MobileNetV2(), and then run directly.

If you want to know more about the network backbones, you can refer to my reviews about all the backbones and lightweight networks. https://github.com/senbinyu/Computer_Vision_Literatures

方便初学者快速上手各种类型的骨架CNNs。

运行指导：在main.py处找到选择model的地方，指定net，例如net = MobileNetV2(), 随后即可一键运行

如果想要系统了解主要网络骨架历史沿袭，文献回顾，请参见https://github.com/senbinyu/Computer_Vision_Literatures
